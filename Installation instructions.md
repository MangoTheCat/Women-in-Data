# Installing R and RStudio 

## Installing R

R is installed from a central repository named CRAN. Most users typically navigate to CRAN via [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) , although you can also navigate directly to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

1.	Click the [download R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) link on the R Project main page.
2.	Choose the most local CRAN mirror. Each mirror is the same, so it does not matter which one you choose, although it helps reduce traffic if you choose a local mirror. 
3.	From the main home page of CRAN, there are three options, depending on your operating system. Click the appropriate link. 



### Installing R on Windows
The following steps describe the process of installing R on Windows: 
1.	There are three available “subdirectories.” Click the link to **base**.
2.	At the top of the page the most recent R release on Windows is available for download via a link (for example: “*Download R 3.4.2 for Windows*”). Click the link to download the installer to a temporary location (or choose run if presented with the option).
3.	If you are asked whether you wish to *run* or *save* the ***.exe*** file, choose *run*.
4.	Once the file has downloaded, run the  ***.exe***  file.
5.	Choose your language and follow the instructions in the wizard. 
    * When presented with the option to configure start-up options, as shown below, it is advised that you select **No** and accept the defaults.
    * Keep clicking **Next** through all the options, assuming you are happy with what the wizard is going to do.
    * When you are ready, click the **Finish** button.
